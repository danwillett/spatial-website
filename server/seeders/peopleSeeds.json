From 2016-2020 she was Director of the School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning at Arizona State University. Prior, she was the Lansdowne Research Professor and Director of the Spatial Pattern Analysis and Research Lab at the University of Victoria, Canada. Dr. Nelson values partnerships, particularly connections between industry and academics, that enable innovation of methods and approaches to solving critical issues.",
        "research": "Dr. Nelson’s current research focuses on active transportation and the use of big data and analytics to better plan cities. Nelson led the creation of BikeMaps.org, a web-map and App to gather volunteered geographic information on bicycling collisions and near misses. With her team, she has developed new ways of using fitness app data (like Strava) to map bicycling volume useful for transportation planning. Nelson uses BikeMaps.org and other big data to quantify and monitor patterns of urban cycling safety and ridership.",

By examining how movement relates to the environment, her work enhances our understanding of social and ecological systems. She applies spatial data science and quantitative methods to model problems such as human-wildlife conflicts, environmental change, natural hazards, the spread of diseases, human mobility, and spatial interaction. Through interdisciplinary research, Dr. Dodge aims to develop a broadly applicable analytical framework to unravel how movement patterns of individuals are driven by their behavior, their environment, and their interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales.",
